# This script checks for Active Directory users whose passwords were last set more than 90 days ago
# and exports the list to a CSV file.

# Steps:
# 1. Import the Active Directory module.
# 2. Set the date threshold to 90 days ago from the current date.
# 3. Retrieve users with a password last set date older than the threshold.
# 4. Select relevant properties (Name, SamAccountName, PasswordLastSet).
# 5. Sort the results by the PasswordLastSet date.
# 6. Export the results to a CSV file located at "C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\script\ADPasswordLastSet.csv".

# Note:
# - Ensure the Active Directory module is installed and available.
# - Replace <username> with the actual username of the user running the script.
